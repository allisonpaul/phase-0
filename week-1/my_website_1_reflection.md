**Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.**

To creat a repository on Github just use the New Repository green button on the right side of the screen. Name the repo, give a quick description, label it either public or private, license accordingly, and pull the trigger with the Create Repository button.
To clone the repostiory back to your computer just copy the link on the right on the screen, go to your command line and type
git clone link_you_just_copied


**Describe what open source means.**

Open source is basically sharing your source code and allowing others to view/ edit a version of it however they see fit. It provides universal access- anyone can see it, anyone can edit it.


**What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?**

At this point, I am all for Open Source.  It's awesome to be able to view and learn from other's and hopefully eventually contribute. In turn people can view my work and comment, critique, build upon it, which I think is really cool.
If I wrote some badass groundbreaking code and everyone could look at it, learn from it, change it, I might feel more protective but I know ultimately people as a whole benefit more from Open Source.


**Assess the importance of using licenses.**

Licenses are really important. Since people can contribute to your code, you need to be established and credited for being the original creator. You need to establish how people can use the code that you create. From what I read, if you don't license your code others don't really have a legal right to use it.
So far in DBC we have only used the MIT license, which is one of the most popular as well as the shortest and broadest. It places almost no restrictions on what someone can do with the content, as long as they include the copyright and the license with the code.
Another popular license is the GNU General Public License which allows users to copy/modify/distribute the file as long as they track the changes in the source file as well as include the lincense and the copyright.



**What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?**

The challenge helped me get more familiar with cloning, creating new branches, navigating around the command line more, as well as pushing and pulling, since we are now saving all our reflections in a repo.  It's become easier to just do these things without second guessing or having to look back to previous modules.


**Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**

Just in general [this](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/appendixa.html) tutorial on the commandline is helpful.  I haven't finished it, but I plan to this weekend.  I also did the codecademy command line course.  It didn't take very long and it was helpful to do while going along the crash course that was assigned.

I also think Githubs [Choose a License](http://choosealicense.com/) site is useful if you ever need help picking what sort of license to put on your code.
