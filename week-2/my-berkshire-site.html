- <What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
    I actually really liked this.  I have been working on my solo project a lot, so it was nice to put my knowledge to use on another site and get outside of my current project.  I found that I knew a lot and could do all of this challenge really easily as well as explain to my partner, who hadn't done much html work yet.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
    I have the HTML&CSS book by Jon Duckett, so I have been referencing that when I did help with something.  I still am a little confused about breaking up my content with <section> and <div> but I'm looking in to it more.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
    My partner wanted to edit colors and font sizes using HTML but I suggested we waited until we learn about css and make a css style sheet for all formatting.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
    HTML seems to be a little limiting. There are so many changes I want to implement right away, positioning mostly, but I have to wait until I learn CSS of course.
    I do struggle with indention and need to research more on proper practices.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
    I honestly don't really have any 'tricks'. I try to structure my page with the doctype, html, head, title, header, body, and footer tags (and their closing counterparts of course) before I begin any content.
