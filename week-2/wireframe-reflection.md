**What is a wireframe?**

A wireframe is visual mock up of a web page. It's really simple and is aimed to show the structure of the site.

**What are the benefits of wireframing?**

One of the benefits of wireframing is it allows you to get a sense of where all the contest will go before you actually start working with code of graphics. You can toy around with the fundamental structure without having to make any changes to major coding or design work.  If you are working with a team or a client it also establishes a clear (albeit basic) vision for the project.
And also, since they are pretty easy to make you could map out several and decide which design you like best.  I made a couple versions for my index page before settling on the final.

**Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**

I liked wireframing, although it kind of stressed me out. I'm not sure what sort of knowledge I will have so I don't want to make a wireframe that I can't back up with code and design.


**Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**

I revised my frame a couple of times.  At first, I had a very simple design but after thinking and browsing the web I decided I want basically one page with a nav bar that jumps down to the section the user is clicking on (as opposed to linking to a new page).

**What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?**

I was really curious about wireframes of other sites so I used Wirify to look around.

**Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**
I at first started to use a web based program for my wireframe but I felt like it was taking too long and also was more trouble than it was worth. Ultimately I hand sketched the wireframe, it was fast and allowed me to think about the actually design instead of the program I was using to design it.
I really didn't want to stress about the wireframe too much, I don't want to feel like it is set in stone.  Since I am my own client I can be fluid with the final design.
