What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

-The six phases of web design are to (1) gather information, (2) plan, (3) design, (4) develop, (5) test and deliver, (6) maintenance.


What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

-The primary goal of my site is to promote myself by showing my work, information about myself along with my contact information, and my social media accounts. It will also feature a link to my blog so they can get to know more about me and my interests.


What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

-My target audience are future employers.  I will cater to them with job-specific information about me! Such as skills, past work experience, etc.. I will know more about how to tailor the site when I start in my job search.


What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

-When users come to my site I want them to be greeted with an image of me and a brief bio.  I want them to learn about me, see my portfolio, and then the perfect end goal, they would hire me, ha! For those not looking to employee me, I would hope the user would use my site just to get an idea of who I am and the work that I do.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

-One major thing people should know about design is it is everywhere.  The design of product plays a huge role in its popularity, its usabilty, its function, the list goes on.  I was once told that good design can change the conversation,but great design can change the world.  This is so true! When you see something with an awesome design you want to use it! I recently discovered a website that curates things from Amazon.  It presents them in an amazing way, is really easy to use, and just makes my shopping experience so much more fun.  I could find all these things on Amazon with a little searching, yet I am still way more into this website.  I think this is a great example of why design is so important! If you and a competitor showcase the exact same product, if theirs is presented in a different way that users find more appealing then you might as well pack it up and go home.
Design requires planning, brainstorming, trial & error, and maintenance. It is not an after thought but a driving force when creating.
User experience as a career is exploding.  People are realizing how important it is to monitor the users experience and improve upon it to make their product as pleasant and functional as possible.  It's main focus is the needs of the user, and since we are a consumer-focused society, it's really crucial to give the user what they are looking for.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

-User experience is how someone reacts with a system, such as a website or an app. Obviously, the point of creating a website or app is so that people use it and enjoy it. UX evaluates the functionality of a system and designs it to be functional, accessible and plesant for the user. It focuses on how the user feels when using the system.  UX is about enhancing the experience people have when using a product.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

-The trickiest part of this challenge for me was figuring out the markdown. It took me three tries to get the file path correct.  At first I started way from the beginning at Users, then I went to short and omitted the week-2 directory. Shoutout to my accountability group for helping!
I heavily considered joining a design bootcamp instead of Dev Bootcamp, so reading the articles about user experince was interesting.  I'd someday like to do both!
