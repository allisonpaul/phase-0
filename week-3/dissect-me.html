        To use version control you need to become familar with git.   Git is the software that equips files with version control and is controlled using the command line.  Go ahead and install git on your local machine in the command line using<br>

        <b>git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"</b><br>

        Once you fill in your email address you are ready to start using git!</p>

        When you create a new directory it's just a plain folder until you initialize git.  You do this one of two ways; with the <b>git init</b> command or by cloning a repository from GitHub using <b>git clone</b> followed by the URL of the repo you are cloning.
        Congratulations, you have made your first git repository!

          While git tracks if you edit, move, or create new files, it does not automatically save these changes. You must manually create save points known as commits via the command line.

          Now that you have initalized or cloned a git repository, it is essential to create a new branch, or a seperate log of commits, to avoid messing with any source code.
          To do this you use <b>git branch -b name_of_your_branch</b>.
          You will do all of your work in this branch until you are ready to merge with what is called the master branch, or the folder where you will keep all the stable, production-ready code. When you are ready to commit use the <b>git add</b> command.  This will move your files to a staging area, and you will then finalize the commit with <b> git commit -m "a message about your commit here"</b>. Putting a message with your commit is really important as you need to tell those you are working with the change that was made, why it was made, who it was made by, and when it was made.  Even if you are working alone on the project, by the end it will probably have hundreds of commits and you need something to show you why each commit was made and what the change in the file was.  A good commit message it short -less than 50 characters, specific, begins with a capital letter, and in the imperative.

          Now that we've learned the what git is and the basics of how to use it, let's talk about GitHub.  GitHub is an awesome resource that allows you to store your repositories in the cloud.  It's really crucial that you have your content saved somewhere other than your machine, as you never know what kind of disaster can occur and then poof, all your hard work is gone. GitHub ensures that your code is safe and can be accessed from other machines.

          In addition to storing code, GitHub allows developers to share and edit projects.  It's great when you are working in teams because all members can upload their feature branches and review them from their local machines before merging to the master branch.
          GitHub is a great social network. You can look at what others are working on, make suggestions or changes,and collaborate.
