//REFLECTION
// What are the biggest similarities and differences between JavaScript and Ruby?
//   -JavaScript is a little more drawn out. The way you declare variables is essential the say, but longer in JavaScript.  In ruby there are way less semicolons, while in javascript semicolons are necessary when there is more than one statement.  Overall, a lot of the functionality seems similar while the actual code is different.

// Was some of your Ruby knowledge solidified by learning another language? If so, which concepts?
// -I feel like Ruby is a long lost friend after working with JavaScript.  Ruby, I miss you! Just using loops and a little bit of logic was solidified for me after reading this. I plan to reread the chapters to let it really soak in.

// How do you feel about diving into JavaScript after reading these chapters?
//   -I feel good about it.  Part of me wishes I had learned JavaScript first so I would have been so excited to see all the functionality of Ruby. I am a little nervous about the syntax change and all those dang semicolons.  JavaScript seems very flexible and doesn't yell at you for forgetting things quite like Ruby does, so I am hoping to get a good grasp on everything this week and not learn something incorrectly.
