// Separate Numbers with Commas in JavaScript **Pairing Challenge**


// I paired [with: Esther Leytush] on this challenge.

// This challenge took me [.5] hours.

// Pseudocode
// Input: integer
//output: Return a comma-seperated integer
// Create a function
//Convert integer to a string
//Convert to an array but calling split, reverse array
//Break up the array into groups of three
//Reverse the subgroups
//Reverse the whole group
//Join with a comma every three
//Return the string





// Initial Solution

function injectComma(integer) {
  var backwardsArray = integer.toString().split('').reverse();
  var splitGroups = new Array ;
  while (backwardsArray.length){
    var group = backwardsArray.splice(0, 3);
    group = group.reverse().join('')
    splitGroups.push(group);
  }
  splitGroups = splitGroups.reverse().join(',');
  console.log(splitGroups);
}

// Refactored Solution




// Your Own Tests (OPTIONAL)




// Reflection

//What was it like to approach the problem from the perspective of JavaScript? Did you approach the problem differently?

// You can't reverse a string directly, you have to convert to an array first, so we had to approach the challenge a little differently.

//What did you learn about iterating over arrays in JavaScript?
// You can't use each, but both 'while' and 'for' loops work the same as in Ruby.

//What was different about solving this problem in JavaScript?
// The syntax is a change, but the main solution was similar logic.

//What built-in methods did you find to incorporate in your refactored solution?
// We used #join, #reverse, and #splice.  Splice adds/removes items to/from an array and returns the removed item.
