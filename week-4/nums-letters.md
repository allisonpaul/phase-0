What is an integer? What is a float?
Numbers without decimal points are integers and numbers with decimal points are floats.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
If you divide floats you will get a precise answer (another float).  If you divide with integers, you will get an integer output.  It's good to use integer division when you need a result with a whole number. Heres an example
puts 12/5
puts 12.0 / 5.0

The top integer example will return an answer of 2.
The bottom float example will return an answer of 2.4
