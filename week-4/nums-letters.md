 What does puts do?
  Puts returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line.
  Puts basically writes on the screen whatever you tell it to.

What is an integer? What is a float?
Numbers without decimal points are integers and numbers with decimal points are floats.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
If you divide floats you will get a precise answer (another float).  If you divide with integers, you will get an integer output.  It's good to use integer division when you need a result with a whole number. Heres an example
puts 12/5
puts 12.0 / 5.0

The top integer example will return an answer of 2.
The bottom float example will return an answer of 2.4


<b>Programs for 2.5</b>


How many hours in a year?
'''puts 24 * 365'''


How many minutes in a year?
'''puts (60 * 24) * 365 * 10'''


How many seconds old are you? (I rounded and just did 25 years!)
'''puts (((60 * 60) * 24) * 365 ) * 25'''


How many seconds old is the author?


'''puts ((((1160000000/ 365 ) /24 ) /60) /60)'''


<b>Reflection</b>

What is the difference between integer and float division?
What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
